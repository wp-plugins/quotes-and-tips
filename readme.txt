= How to use the other language files with Quotes and Tips? = 

Here is an example for the German language files.

1. In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to switch the WP version to the required language and in the configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` type `define('WPLANG', 'de_DE');`. If everything is done properly the admin panel will be in German.

2. Make sure that the the files `de_DE.po` and `de_DE.mo` are present in the plugin (in the languages folder which is in the root of the plugin).

3. If there are no such files you should copy the other files from this folder (for example, for the Russian or Italian language) and rename them (you should write `de_DE` instead of `ru_RU` in both files).

4. You can edit the files using the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please download this program, install it, open the file with this program (the necessary language file) and for each line in English add  translation in German.

5. If everything is done properly all lines will be in German in the admin panel and in the front-end.
